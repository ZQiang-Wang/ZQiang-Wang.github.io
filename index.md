## <i style="color:#e74d3c; font-size: 40px;">I am looking for the post-doc position!!!</i>


## About Me

I completed my PhD degree in information and communication engineering from UESTC in June of 2024. I have a strong background in localization and parameter estimation. During my academic journey, I have developed a keen interest in computationally efficient direct position determination methods and was deeply involved in a project focused on channel state information-based localization.

## Research Interests

- **Direct position determination**, Indoor positioning, Array signal processing, Joint angle and delay estimation, Quantized signal processing, Deep unfolding technique, near-field localization and sensing
